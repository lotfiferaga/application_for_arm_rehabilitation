# About the project
The theme of this project answers the question : 
In order to improve the sensation of touch in an application of
rehabilitation application, can we use vibration-based
feedbacks ?

# Arm rehabilitation application
This is an interactive 3D application in which a patient currently undergoing rehabilitation of one of his arms is asked to perform a task of opening a door with the help of his arm. This task consists in successively operating different models of virtual door handles. Each door handle has a different shape and size than the others.
The grasping of the handle with the virtual hand is indicated by vibrations at the handle. The vibrations increase according to the "hardness" of the handle. The size of the handle affects the angle of rotation of the user's wrist.
